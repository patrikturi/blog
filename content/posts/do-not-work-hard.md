*Work should not be hard and study should not be easy.*

If work is really hard it must be one of the following cases:
* You have no idea what you are doing
* You are trying to work and study at the same time
* You are overwhelmed

Either case you should stop. The first two means the results will be poor or even cause damage. The latter means you are risking burnout.

On the other hand, study should not be too easy. It is the time to get out of your comfortzone. Reading and studying about things you already kind of knew is not that useful.
